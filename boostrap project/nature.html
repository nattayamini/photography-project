      <p>Trees transpire chemical compounds. We are subconsciously aware of these 
compounds and we respond with changes in blood pressure. The tree, for its part, is unaware of our response – after all, we are not in contact with the tree in any way. And even if we hug the tree and talk of electric fields, 
which is one way we could mutually affect each other (because plants, like us, function partially by transmitting electric signals), there is still one huge obstacle: time. Trees, as we all know, are awfully slow. 
You can multiply the time it takes you to make contact with the tree by 10,000 to find out when you can expect a response.</p>

    <p> Trees store memories, respond to attacks and transfer sugar solution, and perhaps even memories, to their offspring. All these abilities suggest that they must also have a brain. But no one has yet found any such thing. 
Professor František Baluška at the University of Bonn has recently been looking into this. For some time now, he has been of the opinion that plants are intelligent – after all, they can process information and make decisions – but consciousness 
takes the discussion to a different level.</p>
